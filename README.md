# lewei-camera

View the cameras of your cheap lewei-based drones using [pylwdrone](https://github.com/meekworth/pylwdrone) [which must be installed globally].

Still in development. This package **does not work properly 100% of the time yet**.

An example is located at [showcam](https://github.com/hieyou1/lewei-camera/tree/master/showcam), which shows your camera feed in the browser.
